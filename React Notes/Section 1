What is React.js?(reactjs.org)

React - 
Javascript Library for building user interfaces
Client side Javascript Library

Example: Netflix

Why react instead of just Javascript/

with just javascript we need to write code for each step we need to describe that and is called imperative approach
(describe step by step)

with react we can divide into small building blocks called components and hence reuse those components and will be 
handled by the Javascript Library react.

React can be used as a SPA where the server sends only 1 HTML page and we can use that to control the UI and 
other functionailities

Extra functionaility that need sot be added while using React we can import other 3rd party libraries

Alternatives of React: Angular (Framework) Vue.js
