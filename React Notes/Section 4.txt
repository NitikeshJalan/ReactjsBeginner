React State and Working with events
-------------------------------------

we do not give parenthesis on events in JSX as JS will execute the Handlers

Example: 

    const clickedHndler = () => {
        console.log("Clicked");
    }

    return (
        <Card className="expense-item">
            <ExpenseDate date={props.date}></ExpenseDate>
            <div className="expense-item__description">
                <h2 className="expense-item h2">{props.title}</h2>
            </div>
            <div className="expense-item__price">Rs {props.amount} /-</div>
            <button onClick={clickedHndler}>Change Title</button>
        </Card>
    );
}

useState is a function to be imported from react library;

Example: 

 const [title, changeTitle] = useState(props.title);

    const clickedHandler = () => {
        changeTitle('Updated');
    }

useState returns an array where the first value is the origianl value assigned 
and the second is the state maintainenece function to change/update the value

the state maintainenece/updation functions re calls the component function again hence updates the value

the state maintainenece function does not changes the value at a go instead schedules the change of state.

useState is per component instance basis and manages different states for same components called more than once

React takes the intial state value in useState for the first time and keeps a track and when the component function
is recalled it doesnt initializes the value with props value again instead updates the value passed 
by the state updation function call.

Always good to maintain seperate states for different variables
As in one state we dependent on previous state when we want to update state

Note: 

If we want to prevent the page to reload on submit then use event.preventDefault();
