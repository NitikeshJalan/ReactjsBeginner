React Basics and Working with Components
------------------------------------------

component - reusable building blocks

Declarative approach to create component -> using states to give React the final desired target

create-react-app (tool) - bunch of configuration files ready for use

Example: 

npx create-react-app my-app 

localhost:3000

index.js is the fle that gets executed in React

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

JSX - JavaScript XML

1) Build your custom react components with a captial letter so that React is able to 
differentiate with HTML element and React component element.

2) return statement accept only one root element

3) instead of class we use className in JSX 

4) Instead of JSX:

import React from 'react';

React.createElement('div' , {className: 'test'}, );

first arg - element name 
second arg - attributes object
third - sibling element creation

thats the reason we need a root element in JSX as from the above code without a root element we cant return more 
than one value.
