Difference between Framework and Library?

Library
1) It is a set of reusable functions 
2) We can call a function in the library and then the control is returned.
3) It can be easily incorporated into an exisiting project and add functionaility
4) Program linking and binding process are some of the core features of a library.

Example: React , Jquery


Framework
1) It is a piece of code that actually dictates the archietechture of the project
2) In framework we never call a function instead the framework calls our code.
3) It cannot be added seamlessly into an already exisiting project
4) Build and deploy applications are best suited for a framework characteristic

Example: Angular
