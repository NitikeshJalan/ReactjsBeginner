Difference between Framework and Library?

Library
1) It is a set of reusable functions 
2) We can call a function in the library and then the control is returned.
3) It can be easily incorporated into an exisiting project and add functionaility
4) Program linking and binding process are some of the core features of a library.

Example: React , Jquery

Framework
1) It is a piece of code that actually dictates the archietechture of the project
2) In framework we never call a function instead the framework calls our code.
3) It cannot be added seamlessly into an already exisiting project
4) Build and deploy applications are best suited for a framework characteristic

Example: Angular

2) Features of React?

- Its uses VirtualDOM instead of RealDOM considering the fact that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
- Supports server side rendering 
- Follows unidirectional data flow or data binding
- Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

3) What is JSX? 

Ans - JSX or JavaScript XML is a XML like syntax extension to ECMAScript.It provides syntactic sugar 
for the React.createElement() function giving us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like 
template syntax.
